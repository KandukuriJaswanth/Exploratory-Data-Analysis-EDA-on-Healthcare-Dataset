# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-on-Healthcare-Dataset

# Summary
You can generate comprehensive data profiling reports using Pandas Profiling or Sweetviz libraries in Python. These tools automatically create summaries, including descriptive statistics, visualizations, correlations, and missing values. By running simple commands, you get detailed insights into your dataset, enabling efficient analysis and decision-making.

# Key features
Identified include the use of essential libraries for data analysis and visualization: **pandas** for data manipulation, **numpy** for numerical operations, **matplotlib.pyplot** and **seaborn** for visualizations, and **ydata_profiling** for automated exploratory data analysis (EDA). The healthcare dataset is loaded from a CSV file on Google Drive. Initial data inspection includes viewing the datasetâ€™s shape, listing column names, and checking the structure using df.info(). Data quality checks involve identifying unique values and exploring missing data. Visualization is carried out using Seaborn and Matplotlib, while automated EDA reports are generated with ydata_profiling.ProfileReport.

# Tech Stack

 Python as the primary programming language for data analysis and visualization. For data manipulation and preprocessing, Pandas is used, while NumPy handles numerical computations and array operations. Data visualization is carried out using Matplotlib for static, interactive, and publication-quality plots, and Seaborn for statistical visualizations with high-level interfaces. To streamline exploratory data analysis, ydata-profiling is utilized to generate automated reports. The analysis is executed on Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment, with data stored on Google Drive for easy access and integration. The dataset is in CSV format and is loaded using Pandas for analysis.
