# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-on-Healthcare-Dataset

# Summary
You can generate comprehensive data profiling reports using Pandas Profiling or Sweetviz libraries in Python. These tools automatically create summaries, including descriptive statistics, visualizations, correlations, and missing values. By running simple commands, you get detailed insights into your dataset, enabling efficient analysis and decision-making.

# Key features
Identified include the use of essential libraries for data analysis and visualization: **pandas** for data manipulation, **numpy** for numerical operations, **matplotlib.pyplot** and **seaborn** for visualizations, and **ydata_profiling** for automated exploratory data analysis (EDA). The healthcare dataset is loaded from a CSV file on Google Drive. Initial data inspection includes viewing the datasetâ€™s shape, listing column names, and checking the structure using df.info(). Data quality checks involve identifying unique values and exploring missing data. Visualization is carried out using Seaborn and Matplotlib, while automated EDA reports are generated with ydata_profiling.ProfileReport.
